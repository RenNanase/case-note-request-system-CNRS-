PROJECT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT

DATE : 21 AUGUST 2025
PROJECT NAME : Case Note Request System (CNRS)

1. Introduction
Currently, in JMC, the process of requesting Case Notes/Medical Notes between the Medical Record Department (MRD) and Clinic Assistants (CA) is manual and time-consuming. This leads to:
	•	Delays in retrieving case notes
	•	Miscommunication between departments
	•	Difficulty in tracking request progress and tracing the physical case note

There is an existing system, but it is too complicated and lacks user-friendliness, which discourages staff from using it effectively.
2. Problem Statement
The absence of a simple, centralized, and user-friendly system has caused:
	•	Longer patient waiting times
	•	Risk of lost or misplaced documents
	•	Increased workload for both Clinic Assistants and Medical Record staff
	•	Lack of proper audit trail and accountability
 
3. Project Objective
To develop a digital, centralized, and user-friendly Case Note Request System (CNRS) that:
	•	Streamlines request and approval of case notes
	•	Improves communication between Clinic Assistants and MRD staff
	•	Provides real-time tracking of case notes
	•	Ensures secure handling of medical records
	•	Reduces administrative workload and waiting times
4. Scope of the Project
In-Scope:
	•	Online request submission by Clinic Assistants
	•	Real-time notifications to MRD staff for new requests
	•	Request status tracking: Pending → In-progress → Completed
	•	Case note movement tracking (e.g., case note transferred to another ward, doctor, or assistant)
	•	Audit log for every case note transaction (who requested, who approved, where it was sent)
	•	Secure login and user authentication for all users
	•	Role-based access (different permissions for CA vs MRD staff vs Admin)
	•	Request history and reporting dashboard

 
5. Key Features
	•	User Management & Authentication
	•	Login system with role-based access control (CA, MR Staff, Admin)
	•	Password reset & account security features
	•	Case Note Request
	•	Online request form (Patient Name / MRN / NRIC, Department, Doctor, Location)
	•	Auto-suggestions for patient search (searchable database)
	•	Approval Workflow
	•	MRD staff view all pending requests
	•	Approve or reject requests with remarks
	•	Case Note Movement Tracking
	•	Ability for CA to update status when handing case notes to another ward, doctor, or CA
	•	Record “handover details” (who, where, when, reason)
	•	Notifications & Alerts
	•	Email/system notification for new requests & approvals
	•	Alerts for overdue or unreturned case notes
	•	Audit Trail & Logs
	•	Full history of requests and movements for accountability
	•	Exportable logs for reporting and compliance
	•	Dashboard & Reporting
	•	Overview of pending, in-progress, and completed requests
	•	Daily/weekly/monthly request statistics
	•	Top departments/doctors requesting notes
 
6. User Flow (High-Level)
Clinic Assistant (CA):
	•	Login portal
	•	Fill out request form → Search Patient (Name/MRN/NRIC) → Select Patient → Select Location → Select Doctor → Submit Request
	•	Track request status in portal
	•	Once case note is received → Update movement (handover to doctor/ward/CA) → Insert reason/details
	•	After note is returned → Mark request as Complete
Medical Record (MR) Staff:
	•	Login portal
	•	View new requests
	•	Approve/reject requests → Assign case note for retrieval
	•	Acknowledge completed requests
	•	View system logs
	•	Generate reports
Admin :
	•	Manage users and permissions

7. Technical Requirements (Recommended)
	•	Frontend: React.js (user-friendly interface)
	•	Backend: Laravel (API + logic)
	•	Database: MySQL (secure data storage)
	•	Authentication: JWT or Laravel Passport for API security
	•	Deployment: On-premise server (hospital IT infra)

8. Expected Benefits
	•	Efficiency: Reduce waiting time for patients
	•	Transparency: Clear tracking of case notes and requests
	•	Accountability: Full audit trail of who accessed and moved case notes
	•	User Adoption: Simple, intuitive interface to encourage daily use
	•	Data-driven decisions: Reporting for management to optimize workflow
