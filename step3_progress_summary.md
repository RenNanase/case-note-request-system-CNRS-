# Step 3: Core Features Development - PROGRESS SUMMARY

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the core Case Note Request functionality for Clinic Assistants (CA), including comprehensive backend APIs and TypeScript foundations for the frontend.

## âœ… COMPLETED: Case Note Request Creation (CA)

### 1. Database Models & Relationships âœ…
- **Completed all model relationships**: Doctor, Location, RequestEvent models with full functionality
- **Added comprehensive model methods**: 
  - Search scopes, validation, and computed attributes
  - Activity logging with Spatie ActivityLog
  - Relationship management and helper methods
- **Sample data creation**: Created seeders with realistic hospital data
  - 10 departments (Cardiology, Emergency, Internal Medicine, etc.)
  - 15 locations (Wards, Clinics, MR Rooms, Archives, etc.)
  - 12 doctors with specializations and department assignments
  - 12 patients with realistic Malaysian data (MRN, NRIC, addresses)

### 2. Backend API Controllers âœ…
- **RequestController**: Full CRUD operations for case note requests
  - `GET /api/requests` - List requests (with role-based filtering)
  - `POST /api/requests` - Create new requests
  - `GET /api/requests/{id}` - View request details with timeline
  - `PUT /api/requests/{id}` - Update pending requests
  - `POST /api/requests/{id}/approve` - Approve requests (MR Staff)
  - `POST /api/requests/{id}/reject` - Reject requests (MR Staff)
  - `POST /api/requests/{id}/complete` - Complete requests (MR Staff)
  - `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard statistics

- **PatientController**: Patient search functionality
  - `GET /api/patients/search?search=term` - Search patients by name, MRN, NRIC
  - `GET /api/patients/{id}` - Get patient details

- **ResourceController**: Form select options
  - `GET /api/resources/departments` - Get department options
  - `GET /api/resources/doctors?department_id=X` - Get doctors (filtered by dept)
  - `GET /api/resources/locations?type=X` - Get locations (filtered by type)
  - `GET /api/resources/priorities` - Get priority options
  - `GET /api/resources/statuses` - Get status options

### 3. API Security & Permissions âœ…
- **Role-based access control**: CA users can only see their own requests
- **Permission checking**: `create_requests`, `approve_requests`, `complete_requests`
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation rules for all endpoints
- **Authentication**: All endpoints protected with `auth:api` middleware

### 4. Frontend TypeScript Foundation âœ…
- **Complete type definitions**: Created `src/types/requests.ts` with all interfaces
- **Type-safe APIs**: Patient, Department, Doctor, Location, Priority types
- **Request management types**: CaseNoteRequest, RequestFormData, RequestEvent
- **API response types**: Proper typing for all API endpoints

## ðŸ§ª TESTED & VERIFIED âœ…

### API Endpoints Tested
- âœ… **Departments API**: Returns 10 departments with codes and labels
- âœ… **Patient Search**: Successfully searches patients by name ("ahmad" â†’ Ahmad Bin Abdullah)
- âœ… **Dashboard Stats**: Returns proper statistics (currently 0 as no requests created yet)
- âœ… **Authentication**: Token-based auth working correctly
- âœ… **Role-based filtering**: CA users get filtered results

### Sample Data Available
- âœ… **10 Departments**: CARD, ED, IM, PEDS, SURG, OBGYN, ORTHO, RAD, PSYCH, MR
- âœ… **12 Doctors**: With titles, specializations, and department assignments  
- âœ… **15 Locations**: Covering wards, clinics, MR rooms, archives, offices

## ðŸš§ NEXT STEPS (Remaining Todos)

### 1. Request Approval Workflow (MR Staff) 
- Build approval/rejection interface for Medical Records staff
- Status tracking and timeline management
- Bulk actions for MR staff efficiency

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard with Role-based Features
- CA Dashboard: My requests, create new, overdue alerts
- MR Staff Dashboard: Pending approvals, workload stats, quick actions  
- Admin Dashboard: System overview, user management, reports

### 3. User Management System (Admin)
- Admin interface for managing users
- Role and permission management
- User activity monitoring

### 4. Additional UI Pages and Components
- Request listing with filters and search
- Request detail view with timeline
- User profile and settings
- Responsive mobile-friendly design
