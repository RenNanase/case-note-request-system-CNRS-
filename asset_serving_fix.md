# Asset Serving Fix for Laravel Frontend

## Problem
The Laravel URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` was displaying a blank page while the Vite dev server `http://localhost:3000/login` worked correctly.

## Root Cause
The Vite build generated HTML with asset paths like `/assets/index-xxx.js` and `/assets/index-xxx.css`, but Laravel's routes were only configured to serve assets from `/frontend/assets/`. When the browser requested `/assets/...`, Laravel's fallback route was serving the HTML file instead of the actual assets.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added `/assets/` route to Laravel
Added a new route in `routes/web.php` to serve assets directly from `/assets/` path:

```php
// Serve assets directly from /assets/ path (for Vite builds)
Route::get('/assets/{file}', function ($file) {
    $path = public_path("frontend/assets/{$file}");
    
    if (!file_exists($path)) {
        abort(404);
    }
    
    $extension = pathinfo($path, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
    $mimeType = match($extension) {
        'css' => 'text/css',
        'js' => 'application/javascript',
        'svg' => 'image/svg+xml',
        'png' => 'image/png',
        'jpg', 'jpeg' => 'image/jpeg',
        default => 'application/octet-stream'
    };
    
    return response(File::get($path), 200)
        ->header('Content-Type', $mimeType);
})->where('file', '.*');
```

### 2. Added `/vite.svg` route  
The favicon was also being caught by the fallback route, so added:

```php
// Serve vite.svg from frontend directory
Route::get('/vite.svg', function () {
    $path = public_path('frontend/vite.svg');
    
    if (!file_exists($path)) {
        abort(404);
    }
    
    return response(File::get($path), 200)
        ->header('Content-Type', 'image/svg+xml');
});
```

## Result
Now Laravel properly serves:
- ✅ HTML from `/` → `public/frontend/index.html`
- ✅ CSS from `/assets/index-xxx.css` → `public/frontend/assets/index-xxx.css`
- ✅ JS from `/assets/index-xxx.js` → `public/frontend/assets/index-xxx.js` 
- ✅ Icon from `/vite.svg` → `public/frontend/vite.svg`
- ✅ API routes from `/api/*` → Laravel API controllers
- ✅ React Router routes handled by fallback

## Testing Status
All assets are now serving with correct:
- ✅ HTTP 200 status codes
- ✅ Proper MIME types (text/css, application/javascript, image/svg+xml)
- ✅ Full content (CSS ~22KB, JS ~457KB, SVG ~1.5KB)

The Laravel URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` should now display the React application correctly with full styling and functionality.
