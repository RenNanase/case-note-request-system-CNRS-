# CRNS Network Deployment Fix

## Problem Description
The CRNS application was experiencing MIME type errors when deployed to the network server at `http://10.2.10.178/crns/`. The error was:

```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
```

This was causing other projects on the same network server to become inaccessible.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Incorrect base path configuration** - Frontend assets were built with `/crns/` base path but Laravel routes weren't configured to handle the subdirectory
2. **Missing MIME type handling** - The server was serving HTML instead of JavaScript/CSS files
3. **Incomplete subdirectory routing** - Laravel wasn't properly routing requests from the `/crns/` subdirectory

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configurations

#### Frontend Vite Config (`frontend/vite.config.ts`)
- Set `base: '/crns/'` for proper subdirectory serving
- Configured asset output paths for consistent naming

#### Root Vite Config (`vite.config.js`)
- Added `base: '/crns/'` for Laravel assets
- Enhanced asset output configuration

### 2. Updated Laravel Routes (`routes/web.php`)
- Added route group with `prefix => 'crns'` to handle subdirectory requests
- Maintained backward compatibility with original routes
- Proper asset serving for `/crns/assets/`, `/crns/frontend/assets/`, etc.

### 3. Enhanced .htaccess (`public/.htaccess`)
- Added comprehensive MIME type handling for all asset types
- Added subdirectory routing rules for `/crns/` requests
- Enhanced asset serving bypass rules

### 4. Created Build Scripts
- `build-for-network.sh` (Linux/Mac)
- `build-for-network.bat` (Windows)

## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Build the Application
```bash
# On Linux/Mac
./build-for-network.sh

# On Windows
build-for-network.bat
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Network Server
Copy the entire project directory to your network server at the location that will be accessible via `http://10.2.10.178/crns/`

### Step 3: Configure Web Server
Ensure your web server (Apache/Nginx) is configured to:
- Serve the project from the correct directory
- Handle the `/crns/` subdirectory properly
- Pass requests to Laravel's `index.php`

## File Structure After Build
```
public/
├── frontend/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── index-[hash].js
│   │   ├── index-[hash].css
│   │   └── [other assets]
│   └── [other frontend files]
├── build/
│   └── [Laravel assets]
└── .htaccess
```

## Access URLs
- **Main Application**: `http://10.2.10.178/crns/`
- **API Endpoints**: `http://10.2.10.178/crns/api/*`
- **Frontend Assets**: `http://10.2.10.178/crns/assets/*`

## Testing
After deployment, verify:
1. ✅ Main page loads at `http://10.2.10.178/crns/`
2. ✅ JavaScript files load with `application/javascript` MIME type
3. ✅ CSS files load with `text/css` MIME type
4. ✅ API endpoints work correctly
5. ✅ Other projects on the server remain accessible

## Troubleshooting

### If MIME type errors persist:
1. Check that `.htaccess` is being processed by Apache
2. Verify `mod_mime` and `mod_rewrite` are enabled
3. Check web server logs for any errors

### If assets still don't load:
1. Verify the build completed successfully
2. Check that frontend assets are in `public/frontend/`
3. Verify Laravel routes are working for the subdirectory

### If other projects become inaccessible:
1. Check that the `.htaccess` rules are specific to `/crns/`
2. Verify no global rewrite rules are interfering
3. Test other project URLs directly

## Benefits of This Fix
- ✅ CRNS runs independently in `/crns/` subdirectory
- ✅ No interference with other projects on the server
- ✅ Proper MIME types for all assets
- ✅ Consistent asset serving
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Easy deployment process
